Note that although this is a real-world task, we will not be using your code; this is not speculative work.

## Instructions
1. Copy or pull this repo to your local machine
2. Complete the task via the inclusion of **new** stylesheets/and or scripts (don't modify existing stylesheets/scripts).
3. Once finished, zip up the project folder and email it to j.d.lineker@soton.ac.uk.

## Task
Create a new template variant that displays a banner when a course is available in clearing. The banner should replace the existing call-to-action buttons.
